# Database Performance Analysis and Optimization using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin 
A project involving analyzing and optimizing SQL queries using PostgreSQL. This project aimed to enhance my understanding of query performance tuning, indexing, and the impact of database isolation levels on query execution.
I began by setting up my environment, which included installing PostgreSQL and PGAdmin, as well as importing the provided Java project, MP2DataGenerator, into Eclipse IDE. The initial setup also involved configuring PostgreSQL logging to capture detailed logs of our activities, which were essential for my analysis and report documentation.
I worked with four different database schemas, each with its specific set of tables and queries. I used the provided shell script to create these schemas and populate them with data. The Java project generated datasets for each schema, and I modified the insertion code to ensure that the data met the requirements specified in the project document. This included ensuring the presence of certain values in the datasets to guarantee meaningful query results.
Schema 1 was designed to simulate a university department scenario. I modified the insertion code to create 60 departments, each offering 20 to 45 courses, with 10 to 35 instructors per department and at least 1100 students per department. The key query for this schema aimed to display all students in the CSEN department and the courses they took in Semester 1 of 2024.
Schema 2 represented a corporate environment with employees, departments, and projects. I adjusted the insertion code to generate 16000 employees, 150 departments, 150 department locations, and 9200 projects. The queries for this schema involved various employee-related operations, such as retrieving projects managed by specific employees, comparing salaries, and identifying employees with dependents.
Schema 3 modeled a boating club with sailors, boats, and reservations. I populated this schema with 19000 sailors, 3000 boats, and 35000 reservations. The queries focused on finding sailors who reserved specific boats, reserved boats of certain colors, and reserved both red and green boats.
Schema 4 simulated a movie database with actors, movies, and directors. I populated this schema with 100,000 movies, 120,000 actors, and 6000 directors. The queries included retrieving actors who played in specific movies, finding directors of certain movies, and listing movies directed by a specific director.
For each schema, I executed the provided queries and analyzed their performance without any indices. I then created various types of indices (B+ trees, hash indices, BRIN indices, GIN indices) and re-ran the queries to observe the impact on performance. I documented the execution plans, estimated costs, and the reasoning behind PostgreSQL's choice of plans. Additionally, I tested different combinations of indices to determine the best mix for optimal query performance.
Throughout the project, I also monitored PostgreSQL locks using the pg_locks system table to understand the different lock types and their purposes during various phases of database operations. This included examining locks after creating tables, during data insertion, and after data insertion.
Finally, I compiled my findings, including screenshots of query outputs, execution plans, and detailed discussions of the observed performance improvements, into a comprehensive report. 
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in database performance tuning, query optimization, and the practical application of indexing strategies to enhance SQL query execution in PostgreSQL.
